# Ubuntu Wordpress Server

In this repository, you can find wordpress optimized configurations for nginx including support for SSL. It also includes a config file for oh-my-zsh and simple backup scripts for wordpress.

Usage of all the files are included in the documentation, but it is prepared for a setup on Amazon AWS. If you want to setup your server on other platforms, you can still use the files, but the server setup would be a little different.
